* Click 'Add Files' then add leddec.vhd

* Click 'Create File' then create two new source files of file type VHDL called counter and hexcount

* Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called hexcount

* Choose Nexys 4 DDR board for the project

* Click 'Finish'

* Click design sources and copy the VHDL code from counter.vhd and hexcount.vhd

* Click constraints and copy the code from hexcount.xdc

### 2. Run synthesis

### 3. Run implementation and open implemented design

### 4. Generate bitstream and open hardware manager

* Click 'Generate Bitstream'

* Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

### 5. Connect Nexys 4 DDR

* The four digit counter counts from 0000 to FFFF
