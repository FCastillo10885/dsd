# Lab 6: Video Game "PONG"

Extend the FPGA code developed in Lab 3 (Bouncing Ball) with Pmod ADC, potentiometer, and VGA display to build a PONG game 

### 1. Create a new RTL project Pong in Vivado Quick Start

* Create four new source files of file type VHDL called vga_sync, bat_n_ball, adc_if, and pong

* Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called pong

* Choose Nexys 4 DDR board for the project

* Click 'Finish'

* Click design sources and copy the VHDL code from vga_sync.vhd, bat_n_ball.vhd, adc_if.vhd, pong.vhd

* Click constraints and copy the code from pong.xdc

### 2. Run synthesis

### 3. Run implementation and open implemented design

### 4. Generate bitstream and open hardware manager

* Click 'Generate Bitstream'

* Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

### 5.
